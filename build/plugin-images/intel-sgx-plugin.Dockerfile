# GOLANG_BASE can be used to make the build reproducible by choosing an
# image by its hash:
# GOLANG_BASE=golang@sha256:9d64369fd3c633df71d7465d67d43f63bb31192193e671742fa1c26ebc3a6210
#
# This is used on release branches before tagging a stable version.
# The main branch defaults to using the latest Golang base image.
ARG GOLANG_BASE=golang:1.18-bullseye

# FINAL_BASE can be used to configure the base image of the final image.
#
# This is used in two ways:
# 1) make <image-name> BUILDER=<docker|buildah>
# 2) docker build ... -f <image-name>.Dockerfile
#
# The project default is 1) which sets FINAL_BASE=gcr.io/distroless/static
# (see build-image.sh).
# 2) and the default FINAL_BASE is primarily used to build Redhat Certified Openshift Operator container images that must be UBI based. 
# The RedHat build tool does not allow additional image build parameters.
ARG FINAL_BASE=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8-micro
