## Introduction

The VPU device plugin supports below cards:

[Intel VCAC-A](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/media-analytics-vcac-a-accelerator-card-by-celestica-datasheet.pdf).
This card has:
- 1 Intel Core i3-7100U processor
- 12 MyriadX VPUs
- 8GB DDR4 memory
- PCIe interface to Xeon E3/E5 server

[Intel Mustang V100](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/introducing-the-iei-tank-aiot-developer-kit-and-mustang-v100-mx8-pcie-accelerator-card).
This card has:
- 8 MyriadX VPUs
- PCIe interface to 6th+ Generation Core PC or Xeon E3/E5 server

[Gen 3 Intel® Movidius™ VPU HDDL VE3](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/movidius-vpu.html)
This card has:
- 3 Intel® Movidius Gen 3 Intel® Movidius™ VPU SoCs


> **Note:** This device plugin need HDDL daemon service to be running either natively or from a container.
>      To get VCAC-A or Mustang card running hddl, please refer to:

## Installation

The following sections detail how to obtain, build, deploy and test the VPU device plugin.

Examples are provided showing how to deploy the plugin either using a DaemonSet or by hand on a per-node basis.

### Getting the source code

> **Note:** It is presumed you have a valid and configured [golang](https://golang.org/) environment
> that meets the minimum required version.

```bash
$ mkdir -p $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/intel
$ git clone https://github.com/intel/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/intel/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes
```

### Deploying as a DaemonSet

To deploy the vpu plugin as a daemonset, you first need to build a container image for the
plugin and ensure that is visible to your nodes.

#### Build the plugin image

The following will use `docker` to build a local container image called
`intel/intel-vpu-plugin` with the tag `devel`.

The image build tool can be changed from the default `docker` by setting the `BUILDER` argument
to the [`Makefile`](/Makefile).

```bash
$ cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/intel/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes
$ make intel-vpu-plugin
...
Successfully tagged intel/intel-vpu-plugin:devel
```

#### Deploy plugin DaemonSet

You can then use the [example DaemonSet YAML](/deployments/vpu_plugin/base/intel-vpu-plugin.yaml)
file provided to deploy the plugin. The default kustomization that deploys the YAML as is:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -k deployments/vpu_plugin
daemonset.apps/intel-vpu-plugin created
```

> **Note**: It is also possible to run the VPU device plugin using a non-root user. To do this,
the nodes' DAC rules must be configured to device plugin socket creation and kubelet registration.
Furthermore, the deployments `securityContext` must be configured with appropriate `runAsUser/runAsGroup`.

For xlink device, deploy DaemonSet as
```bash
$ kubectl apply -k deployments/vpu_plugin/overlays/xlink
daemonset.apps/intel-vpu-plugin created
```

### Deploy by hand

For development purposes, it is sometimes convenient to deploy the plugin 'by hand' on a node.
In this case, you do not need to build the complete container image, and can build just the plugin.

#### Build the plugin

First we build the plugin:

> **Note:** this vpu plugin has dependency of libusb-1.0-0-dev, you need install it before building vpu plugin

```bash
$ cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/intel/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes
$ make vpu_plugin
```

#### Run the plugin as administrator

Now we can run the plugin directly on the node:

```bash
$ sudo $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/intel/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes/cmd/vpu_plugin/vpu_plugin
VPU device plugin started
```

### Verify plugin registration

You can verify the plugin has been registered with the expected nodes by searching for the relevant
resource allocation status on the nodes:

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes -o=jsonpath="{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{'\n'}{' hddl: '}{.status.allocatable.vpu\.intel\.com/hddl}{'\n'}"
vcaanode00
 hddl: 12
```

### Testing the plugin

We can test the plugin is working by deploying the provided example OpenVINO image with HDDL plugin enabled.

#### Build a Docker image with an classification example

```bash
$ cd demo
$ ./build-image.sh ubuntu-demo-openvino
...
Successfully tagged ubuntu-demo-openvino:devel
```

#### Create a job running unit tests off the local Docker image

```bash
$ cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/intel/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes
$ kubectl apply -f demo/intelvpu-job.yaml
job.batch/intelvpu-demo-job created
```

#### Review the job logs

```bash
$ kubectl get pods | fgrep intelvpu
# substitute the 'xxxxx' below for the pod name listed in the above
$ kubectl logs intelvpu-demo-job-xxxxx

If the pod did not successfully launch, possibly because it could not obtain the vpu HDDL
resource, it will be stuck in the `Pending` status:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
intelvpu-demo-job-xxxxx   0/1     Pending   0          8s
```

This can be verified by checking the Events of the pod:

```bash
$ kubectl describe pod intelvpu-demo-job-xxxxx
...
