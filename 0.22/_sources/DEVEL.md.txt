## How to develop simple device plugins

To create a simple device plugin without the hassle of developing your own gRPC
server, you can use a package included in this repository called
`github.com/intel/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes/pkg/deviceplugin`.

All you have to do is instantiate a `deviceplugin.Manager` and call
its `Run()` method:

```go
func main() {
    ...

    manager := dpapi.NewManager(namespace, plugin)
    manager.Run()
}
```

The manager's constructor accepts two parameters:

1. `namespace` which is a string like "color.example.com". All your devices
   will be exposed under this name space, e.g. "color.example.com/yellow".
   Please note that one device plugin can register many such "colors".
   The manager will instantiate multiple gRPC servers for every registered "color".
2. `plugin` which is a reference to an object implementing one mandatory
   interface `deviceplugin.Scanner`.

`deviceplugin.Scanner` defines one method `Scan()` which is called only once
for every device plugin by `deviceplugin.Manager` in a goroutine and operates
in an infinite loop. A `Scan()` implementation scans the host for devices and
sends all found devices to a `deviceplugin.Notifier` instance. The
`deviceplugin.Notifier` is implemented and provided by the `deviceplugin`
package itself. The found devices are organized in an instance of
`deviceplugin.DeviceTree` object. The object is filled in with its
`AddDevice()` method:

```go
func (dp *devicePlugin) Scan(notifier deviceplugin.Notifier) error {
    for {
        devTree := deviceplugin.NewDeviceTree()
        ...
        devTree.AddDevice("yellow", devID, deviceplugin.DeviceInfo{
            State: health,
            Nodes: []pluginapi.DeviceSpec{
                {
                    HostPath:      devPath,
                    ContainerPath: devPath,
                    Permissions:   "rw",
                },
            },
        })
        ...
        notifier.Notify(devTree)
    }
}
```

Optionally, your device plugin may also implement the
`deviceplugin.PostAllocator` interface. If implemented, its method
`PostAllocate()` modifies `pluginapi.AllocateResponse` responses just
before they are sent to `kubelet`. To see an example, refer to the FPGA
plugin which implements this interface to annotate its responses.

In case you want to implement the whole allocation functionality in your
device plugin, you can implement the optional `deviceplugin.Allocator`
interface. In this case `PostAllocate()` is not called. But if you decide in your
implementation of `deviceplugin.Allocator` that you need to resort to the default
implementation of the allocation functionality then return an error of the type
`deviceplugin.UseDefaultMethodError`.

### Logging

The framework uses [`klog`](https://github.com/kubernetes/klog) as its logging
framework. It is encouraged for plugins to also use `klog` to maintain uniformity
in the logs and command line options.

The framework initialises `klog`, so further calls to `klog.InitFlags()` by
plugins should not be necessary. This does add a number of log configuration
options to your plugin, which can be viewed with the `-h` command line option of your
plugin.

The framework tries to adhere to the Kubernetes
[Logging Conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-instrumentation/logging.md).
The advise is to use the `V()` levels for `Info()` calls, as calling `Info()`
with no set level will make configuration and filtering of logging via the command
line more difficult.

The default is to not log `Info()` calls. This can be changed using the plugin command
line `-v` parameter. The additional annotations prepended to log lines by 'klog' can be disabled
with the `-skip_headers` option.

### Error Conventions

The framework has a convention for producing and logging errors. Ideally plugins will also adhere
to the convention.

Errors generated within the framework and plugins are instantiated with the `New()` and
`Errorf()` functions of the [errors package](https://golang.org/pkg/errors/):

```golang
    return errors.New("error message")
```

Errors generated from outside the plugins and framework are augmented with their stack dump with code such as

```golang
    return errors.WithStack(err)
```

or

```golang
    return errors.Wrap(err, "some additional error message")
```

These errors are then logged using a default struct value format like:

```golang
    klog.Errorf("Example of an internal error death: %+v", err)
```

at the line where it's certain that the error cannot be passed out farther nor handled gracefully.
Otherwise, they can be logged as simple values:

```golang
    klog.Warningf("Example of a warning due to an external error: %v", err)
```

### Checklist for new device plugins

For new device plugins contributed to this repository, below is a
checklist to get the plugin on par feature and quality wise with
others:

1. Plugin binary available in [`cmd/`](cmd), its corresponding Dockerfile in [`build/docker/`](build/docker) and deployment Kustomization/YAMLs in [`deployments/`](deployments).
2. Plugin binary Go unit tests implemented and passing with >80% coverage: `make test WHAT=./cmd/<plugin>`.
3. Plugin binary linter checks passing: `make lint`.
4. Plugin e2e tests implemented in [`test/e2e/`](test/e2e) and passing: `go test -v ./test/e2e/... -args -ginkgo.focus "<plugin>"`.
5. Plugin CRD API added to [`pkg/apis/deviceplugin/v1`](pkg/apis/deviceplugin/v1) and CRDs generated: `make generate`.
6. Plugin CRD validation tests implemented in [`test/envtest/`](test/envtest) and passing: `make envtest`.
7. Plugin CRD controller implemented in [`pkg/controllers/`](pkg/controllers) and added to the manager in `cmd/operator/main.go`.
8. Plugin documentation written `cmd/<plugin>/README.md` and optionally end to end demos created in [`demo`](demo).

## How to build against a newer version of Kubernetes

First you need to update module dependencies. The easiest way is to use the
script copied from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/79384#issuecomment-521493597:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
set -euo pipefail

VERSION=${1#"v"}
if [ -z "$VERSION" ]; then
    echo "Must specify version!"
    exit 1
fi
MODS=($(
    curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/v${VERSION}/go.mod |
    sed -n 's|.*k8s.io/\(.*\) => ./staging/src/k8s.io/.*|k8s.io/\1|p'
))
for MOD in "${MODS[@]}"; do
    V=$(
        go mod download -json "${MOD}@kubernetes-${VERSION}" |
        sed -n 's|.*"Version": "\(.*\)".*|\1|p'
    )
    go mod edit "-replace=${MOD}=${MOD}@${V}"
done
go get "k8s.io/kubernetes@v${VERSION}"
```

Just run it inside the repo's root, e.g.

```
$ ./k8s_gomod_update.sh 1.18.1
```
Finally run

```
$ make generate
$ make test
```

and fix all new compilation issues.

## How to work with Intel Device Plugins operator modifications

There are few useful steps when working with changes to Device Plugins CRDs and controllers:

1. Install controller-gen: `GO111MODULE=on go get -u sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/cmd/controller-gen@<release ver>, e.g, v0.4.1`
2. Generate CRD and Webhook artifacts: `make generate`
3. Test local changes using [envtest](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/envtest.html): `make envtest`
4. Build a custom operator image: `make intel-deviceplugin-operator`
5. (Un)deploy operator: `kubectl [apply|delete] -k deployments/operator/default`

## How to publish a new version of the Intel Device Plugins operator to operatorhub.io

Update metadata.annotations.containerImage and metadata.annotations.createdAT fields in the base CSV manifest file
deployments/operator/manifests/bases/intel-device-plugins-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml
to match current operator version and current date

Generate package manifests with:
```
$ make packagemanifests OPERATOR_VERSION=0.X.Y
```

Verify the operator deployment works OK via OLM in your development cluster:
```
$ operator-sdk olm install
$ kubectl create namespace testoperator
$ operator-sdk run packagemanifests --namespace testoperator --version 0.X.Y
# do verification checks
...
# do clean up
$ operator-sdk cleanup intel-device-plugins-operator --namespace testoperator
$ kubectl delete namespace testoperator
$ operator-sdk olm uninstall
```

Review the package manifests by uploading the generated `packagemanifests` folder to
https://operatorhub.io -> Contribute -> Package Your Operator.

Clone the [Community Operators](https://github.com/k8s-operatorhub/community-operators) repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/k8s-operatorhub/community-operators
```

Copy the generated files to the Community Operators repo:
```
$ cp -r packagemanifests/* community-operators/operators/intel-device-plugins/
```
