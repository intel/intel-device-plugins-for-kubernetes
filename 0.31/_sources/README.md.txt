## Prerequisites

Prerequisites for building and running these device plugins include:

- Appropriate hardware and drivers
- A fully configured [Kubernetes cluster]
- A working [Go environment], of at least version v1.16.

## Plugins

The below sections detail existing plugins developed using the framework.

### GPU Device Plugin

The [GPU device plugin](cmd/gpu_plugin/README.md) provides access to
discrete and integrated Intel GPU device files.

The demo subdirectory contains both a [GPU plugin demo video](demo/readme.md#intel-gpu-device-plugin-demo-video)
and an OpenCL sample deployment (`intelgpu-job.yaml`).

### FPGA Device Plugin

The [FPGA device plugin](cmd/fpga_plugin/README.md) supports FPGA passthrough for
the following hardware:

- Intel® Arria® 10 devices
- Intel® Stratix® 10 devices

The FPGA plugin comes as three parts.

- the [device plugin](#device-plugin)
- the [admission controller](#admission-controller)
- the [OCI createRuntime hook](#OCI-createRuntime-hook)

Refer to each individual sub-components documentation for more details.
Brief overviews of the sub-components are below.

The demo subdirectory contains a
[video](demo/readme.md#intel-fpga-device-plugin-demo-video) showing deployment
and use of the FPGA plugin. Sources relating to the demo can be found in the
[opae-nlb-demo](demo/opae-nlb-demo) subdirectory.

#### Device Plugin

The [FPGA device plugin](cmd/fpga_plugin/README.md) is responsible for
discovering and reporting FPGA devices to `kubelet`.

#### Admission Controller

The [FPGA admission controller webhook](cmd/fpga_admissionwebhook/README.md)
is responsible for performing mapping from user-friendly function IDs to the
Interface ID and Bitstream ID that are required for FPGA programming. It also
implements access control by namespacing FPGA configuration information.

#### OCI createRuntime Hook

The [FPGA OCI createRuntime hook](cmd/fpga_crihook/README.md) performs discovery
of the requested FPGA function bitstream and programs FPGA devices based on the
environment variables in the workload description.

### [QAT](https://developer.intel.com/quickassist) Device Plugin

The [QAT plugin](cmd/qat_plugin/README.md) supports device plugin for Intel QAT adapters, and includes
code [showing deployment](cmd/qat_plugin/dpdkdrv) via [DPDK](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/cryptodevs/qat.html).

The demo subdirectory includes details of both a
[QAT DPDK demo](demo/readme.md#intel-quickassist-technology-device-plugin-with-dpdk-demo-video)
and a [QAT OpenSSL demo](demo/readme.md#intel-quickassist-technology-device-plugin-openssl-demo-video).
Source for the OpenSSL demo can be found in the [relevant subdirectory](demo/openssl-qat-engine).

Details for integrating the QAT device plugin into [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/)
can be found in the
[Kata Containers documentation repository](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/use-cases/using-Intel-QAT-and-kata.md).

### SGX Device Plugin

The [SGX device plugin](cmd/sgx_plugin/README.md) allows workloads to use
Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) on
platforms with SGX Flexible Launch Control enabled, e.g.,:

- 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor family, code-named “Ice Lake”
- Intel® Xeon® E3 processor
- Intel® NUC Kit NUC7CJYH

The Intel SGX plugin comes in three parts.

- the [device plugin](#sgx-plugin)
- the [admission webhook](#sgx-admission-webhook)
- the [SGX EPC memory registration](#sgx-epc-memory-registration)

The demo subdirectory contains a [video](demo/readme.md#intel-sgx-device-plugin-demo-video) showing the deployment
and use of the Intel SGX device plugin. Sources relating to the demo can be found in the
[sgx-sdk-demo](demo/sgx-sdk-demo) and [sgx-aesmd-demo](demo/sgx-aesmd-demo) subdirectories.

Brief overviews of the Intel SGX sub-components are given below.

<a name="sgx-plugin"></a>
#### device plugin

The [SGX device plugin](cmd/sgx_plugin/README.md) is responsible for discovering
and reporting Intel SGX device nodes to `kubelet`.

Containers requesting Intel SGX resources in the cluster should not use the
device plugins resources directly.

#### Intel SGX Admission Webhook

The Intel SGX admission webhook is responsible for performing Pod mutations based on
the `sgx.intel.com/quote-provider` pod annotation set by the user. The purpose
of the webhook is to hide the details of setting the necessary device resources
and volume mounts for using Intel SGX remote attestation in the cluster. Furthermore,
the Intel SGX admission webhook is responsible for writing a pod/sandbox
`sgx.intel.com/epc` annotation that is used by Kata Containers to dynamically
adjust its virtualized Intel SGX encrypted page cache (EPC) bank(s) size.

The Intel SGX admission webhook is available as part of
[Intel Device Plugin Operator](cmd/operator/README.md) or
as a standalone [SGX Admission webhook image](cmd/sgx_admissionwebhook/README.md).

#### Intel SGX EPC memory registration

The Intel SGX EPC memory available on each node is registered as a Kubernetes extended resource using
node-feature-discovery (NFD). An NFD Node Feature Rule is installed as part of
[SGX device plugin](cmd/sgx_plugin/README.md)
operator deployment and NFD is configured to register the Intel SGX EPC memory
extended resource.

Containers requesting Intel SGX EPC resources in the cluster use
`sgx.intel.com/epc` resource which is of
type [memory](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory).

### DSA Device Plugin

The [DSA device plugin](cmd/dsa_plugin/README.md) supports acceleration using
the Intel Data Streaming accelerator(DSA).

### DLB Device Plugin

The [DLB device plugin](cmd/dlb_plugin/README.md) supports Intel Dynamic Load
Balancer accelerator(DLB).

### IAA Device Plugin

The [IAA device plugin](cmd/iaa_plugin/README.md) supports acceleration using
the Intel Analytics accelerator(IAA).

## Device Plugins Operator

To simplify the deployment of the device plugins, a unified device plugins
operator is implemented.

Currently the operator has support for the DSA, DLB, FPGA, GPU, IAA, QAT, and
Intel SGX device plugins. Each device plugin has its own custom resource
definition (CRD) and the corresponding controller that watches CRUD operations
to those custom resources.

The [Device plugins operator README](cmd/operator/README.md) gives the installation and usage details for the community operator available on [operatorhub.io](https://operatorhub.io/operator/intel-device-plugins-operator).

The [Device plugins Operator for OpenShift](https://github.com/intel/intel-technology-enabling-for-openshift) gives the installation and usage details for the operator available on [Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/operators/detail/61e9f2d7b9cdd99018fc5736).

## XeLink XPU Manager Sidecar

To support interconnected GPUs in Kubernetes, XeLink sidecar is needed.

The [XeLink XPU Manager sidecar README](cmd/xpumanager_sidecar/README.md) gives information how the sidecar functions and how to use it.

## Intel GPU Level-Zero sidecar

Sidecar uses Level-Zero API to provide additional GPU information for the GPU plugin that it cannot get through sysfs interfaces.

See [Intel GPU Level-Zero sidecar README](cmd/gpu_levelzero/README.md) for more details.

## Demos

The [demo subdirectory](demo/readme.md) contains a number of demonstrations for
a variety of the available plugins.

## Workload Authors

For workloads to get accesss to devices managed by the plugins, the
`Pod` spec must specify the hardware resources needed:

```
spec:
  containers:
    - name: demo-container
      image: <registry>/<image>:<version>
      resources:
        limits:
          <device namespace>/<resource>: X
```

The summary of resources available via plugins in this repository is given in the list below.

**Device Namespace : Registered Resource(s)**
 * `dlb.intel.com`  : `pf` or `vf`
   * [dlb-libdlb-demo-pod.yaml](demo/dlb-libdlb-demo-pod.yaml)

## Releases

### Supported Kubernetes Versions

Releases are made under the github [releases area](https://github.com/intel/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes/releases). Supported releases and
matching Kubernetes versions are listed below:

| Branch            | Kubernetes branch/version      | Status      |
|:------------------|:-------------------------------|:------------|
| release-0.31      | Kubernetes 1.31 branch v1.31.x | supported   |
| release-0.30      | Kubernetes 1.30 branch v1.30.x | supported   |

| release-0.20      | Kubernetes 1.20 branch v1.20.x | unsupported |

*Note:* Device plugins leverage the Kubernetes v1 API. The API itself is GA (generally available) and [does not change](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-changes) between Kubernetes versions. One does not necessarily need to use the latest Kubernetes cluster with the latest device plugin version. Using a newer device plugins release should work without issues on an older Kubernetes cluster. One possible exception to this are the device plugins CRDs that can vary between versions.

### Release procedures

Project's release cadence is tied to Kubernetes release cadence. Device plugins release typically follows a couple of weeks after the Kubernetes release. There can be some delays on the releases due to required changes in the pull request pipeline. Once the content is available in the `main` branch and CI & e2e validation <span style="color:green">PASS</span>es, release branch will be created (e.g. release-0.26). The HEAD of release branch will also be tagged with the corresponding [tag](https://github.com/intel/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes/tags) (e.g. v0.26.0).

During the [release creation](https://github.com/intel/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes/issues/1393), the project's documentation, deployment files etc. will be [changed](https://github.com/intel/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes/pull/1441) to point to the newly created version.

Patch releases (e.g. 0.26.3) are done on a need basis if there are security issues or minor fixes requested for specific version. Fixes are always cherry-picked from the `main` branch to the release branches.

## Pre-built plugin images

Pre-built images of the plugins are available on the Docker hub. These images
are automatically built and uploaded to the hub from the latest main branch of
this repository.

Release tagged images of the components are also available on the Docker hub,
tagged with their release version numbers in the format x.y.z, corresponding to
the branches and releases in this repository.

**Note:** the default deployment files and operators are configured with
[imagePullPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#updating-images)
```IfNotPresent``` and can be changed with ```scripts/set-image-pull-policy.sh```.

### Signed container images

Starting from 0.31 release, the images (`0.31.0` etc., not `devel`) are signed with keyless signing using `cosign`. The signing proof is stored in [rekor.sigstore.dev](https://rekor.sigstore.dev) in an append-only transparency log. The signature is also stored within the dockerhub.

To verify the signing in Kubernetes, one can use [policy managers](https://docs.sigstore.dev/policy-controller/overview/) with [keyless authorities](https://docs.sigstore.dev/policy-controller/overview/#configuring-keyless-authorities).

## License

All of the source code required to build intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes
is available under Open Source licenses. The source code files identify external Go
modules used. Binaries are distributed as container images on
DockerHub*. Those images contain license texts and source code under `/licenses`.

### Helm Charts

Device Plugins Helm Charts are located in Intel Helm Charts repository [Intel Helm Charts](https://github.com/intel/helm-charts). This is another way of distributing Kubernetes resources of the device plugins framework.

To add repo:
```
helm repo add intel https://intel.github.io/helm-charts
